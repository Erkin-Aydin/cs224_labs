# cs224_labs
These are my submissions to labs of CS-224 course given in İhsan Doğramacı Bilkent University, in 2021-2022 Spring Semester.

There are 7 lab assignments in total, their purpose is to teach how computers work, how things go in low-level. I found particularly single-cycle 
MIPS Processor and Pipelined Mips Processor parts of this course entertaining.

Here is a list of all of the subjects of this course:

1)MIPS Assembly Language, 
2)Machine Language,
3)Programming in MIPS,
4)MIPS programs, Addressing Modes 
5)Compiling, Assembling, Loading, Linking, Pseudo-Instructions, Exceptions, 
6)Floating-Point Numbers, 
7)Microarchitecture, 
8)Single-Cycle Processor, Performance Analysis
9)Adding New Instructions
10)Pipelined Processor
11)Hazards, Forwarding, Stalling,
12)Advanced Microarchitectures
13)Caches, Virtual Memory, VM-paging and TLB
14)Memory mapped I/O, parallel I/O,
    Serial I/O w/ SPI, w/ UART; Timers & interrupts,
    Analog I/O, character LCDs, DC motors, I/O for
    PCs
